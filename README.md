# 🍄 **ShroomDB**  
### *A tiny, single‑file, segment‑based storage engine that grows on you.*

Welcome to **ShroomDB**, the storage engine inspired by nature’s most underrated engineers: mushrooms.

Just like a real mushroom is only the tip of a vast, efficient underground network, ShroomDB stores your data in a compact, linked, page‑based structure that’s small, flexible, and surprisingly powerful.

It’s not a database.  
It’s not a filesystem.  
It’s… something in between.  
A **mycelial storage layer** for thousands of tiny, independent data blobs.

## 🌱 **What is ShroomDB?**

ShroomDB is a **single‑file, variable‑segment storage engine** designed for:

- many small independent records (“tokens”)
- variable‑length data
- compactness above all else
- predictable performance
- deterministic layout (easy to hash, audit, replicate)
- embedded use cases
- fun

It’s built around three simple ideas:

1. **Tokens**  
   Each token has its own mini‑storage, like a tiny mushroom cap.

2. **Segments**  
   Data is stored in small variable‑length chunks linked together.

3. **Pages**  
   The file is divided into pages, each with minimal metadata and maximum usable space.

Everything lives in one file.  
Everything is deterministic.  
Everything is tiny and efficient.

## 🍄 **Why “ShroomDB”?**

Because mushrooms are:

- compact  
- efficient  
- modular  
- self‑organizing  
- surprisingly powerful  
- and honestly… fun  

Also, “ShroomDB” is way more memorable than “Segmented Variable‑Length Multi‑Page Storage Engine v0.1”.

---

## 🧱 **Core Concepts**

### **📦 Tokens**
A token is a logical storage unit.  
Think of it as a mini‑file inside the big file.

Each token has:

- an ID  
- total length  
- first page + offset  
- number of pages used  

Tokens are independent — no global schema, no shared structure.

---

### **🧩 Segments**
Data is stored in **segments**:

```
[Length: 2 bytes]
[Data: N bytes]
[NextOffset: 2 bytes]
```

Segments link together to form a chain.  
This allows:

- variable‑length data  
- efficient small writes  
- minimal overhead  
- flexible growth  

---

### **📄 Pages**
The file is divided into pages (up to ~65 KB each).

Each page has **minimal metadata**:

- PageType (index / storage / free)
- UsedSize
- Reserved (future checksum or ID)

Everything else is raw storage.

---

### **🗑 Free Space Index**
When data is deleted, its segments are added to the **free space index**.

This index is the allocator:

- finds space for new writes  
- tracks fragmentation  
- enables compaction  
- lives inside the same file  

No wasted space.  
No external metadata.  
No magic.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Single‑file storage**  
  Easy to hash, copy, replicate, or embed.

- **Tiny overhead**  
  Segments are compact, pages are compact, everything is compact.

- **Independent variable‑size records**  
  Perfect for metadata, small objects, configs, flags, counters, etc.

- **Deterministic layout**  
  Great for auditability and cryptographic hashing.

- **Free‑space reuse**  
  Efficient allocation without fragmentation explosions.

- **Friendly API**

## 🧪 **What ShroomDB is NOT**

- Not a SQL database  
- Not a key‑value store  
- Not a document store  
- Not a filesystem  
- Not a mushroom‑themed blockchain (yet)

It’s a **storage engine** — the layer *under* all those things.

---

## 🛠 **Use Cases**

- Embedded systems  
- Game engines  
- Blockchain-like state storage  
- Config/state blobs  
- Metadata stores  
- Anything needing thousands of tiny independent storages  

---

## 📚 **Example (coming soon)**

```csharp
var db = ShroomDB.Open("state.shroom");

db.Put(tokenId, data);
var bytes = db.Get(tokenId);
db.Delete(tokenId);

db.Flush();
```

## 🧬 **Roadmap**

- [ ] v0.1 — Core engine (pages, segments, index, free list)
- [ ] v0.2 — Compaction
- [ ] v0.3 — Streaming writes
- [ ] v0.4 — Snapshots
- [ ] v0.5 — Hashing the entire file
- [ ] v1.0 — Stable API + docs

## 🌋 **Why ShroomDB Exists**

ShroomDB wasn’t born out of academic theory, a whitepaper, or a committee of enterprise architects.  
It exists because I needed it.

While building a **non‑distributed, “secure‑enough (at your own risk 😄)” ledger system**, I ran into a very real problem:

I needed a storage engine that could:

- live in a single file  
- store thousands of tiny independent records  
- grow organically  
- avoid wasting space  
- be deterministic enough to hash the entire state  
- be simple enough to audit  
- be compact enough to embed anywhere  
- and not drag in a full database just to store a few kilobytes of metadata  

Nothing out there fit the bill.

Traditional databases were too heavy.  
Key‑value stores were too coarse.  
Filesystems were too rigid.  
And rolling my own ad‑hoc format felt like a trap.

So ShroomDB emerged — a tiny, page‑based, segment‑linked storage layer inspired by the way **mycelium** spreads underground: efficiently, compactly, and with minimal overhead.

It’s not meant to replace your production database.  
It’s not meant to secure billions of dollars.  
It’s meant to be **practical**, **predictable**, and **pleasant** for projects that need a lightweight, deterministic storage core.

If you need a compact, single‑file, variable‑segment storage engine for your own experiments, embedded systems, or “secure‑enough” ledgers…  
ShroomDB might just grow on you.
